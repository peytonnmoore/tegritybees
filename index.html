          <h3>Beekeeping Practice</h3>
          <p>We keep bees primarily to connect with nature and to be active participants in our urban food web. Our bees are nestled in our innercity backyard apiary, and waggle-dance to and from the seasonal blooms in our garden, neighbourhood, parks and city.</p>
          <img class="honey-img" src="https://image.flaticon.com/icons/svg/135/135600.svg" alt="honeypot">
          <h3>Honey</h3>
          <p>We produce bee-friendly, low intervention, single source honey. Our honey is raw to preserve the delicate enzymes bees add to the nectar, and it is coursly filtered to keep beneficial bits of pollen, propolis, and wax. Each small batch has its own unique flavour directly related to which flowers the bees are feeding on season to season. This is the good stuff. </p>

          <h3>Mead</h3>
          <p> We are on a mission to make mead. Also known as honey wine, it is the world's oldest source of booze fermenting honey, water, yeast and aromatics. Its a bit of a moonshine operation, so reach out if youd like a swig.  </p>
          <img class="wax-img" src="https://image.flaticon.com/icons/svg/138/138540.svg" alt="goldbrick">
          <h3>Beeswax</h3>
          <p>Beeswax takes the bees a tremendous amount of energy to produce, so we try to preserve the comb and give it back to the bees whenever we can. However, we ocassionally have cappings to process to make candles, skincare products and wraps. Limited availability.</p>

        We acknowledge the traditional custodians of the land of the places we beekeep on today. We also acknowledge our gratitude that we share this land today, our sorrow for some of the costs of that sharing, and our hope and belief that we can move to a place of equity, justice and partnership together.
